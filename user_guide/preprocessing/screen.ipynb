    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Screen data refers to the information about the status of the screen as reported by Android. These data can reveal important information about people's circadian rhythm, social patterns, and activity. Screen data is an event data, this means that it cannot be sampled at a regular frequency. We just have information about the events that occured.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataframe with screen data should contain the following columns (column names can be different, but in that case they must be provided as parameters):\n",
    "- `user`: Subject ID\n",
    "- `device`: Device ID\n",
    "- `screen_status`: An integer indicating screen new status. https://awareframework.com/battery/\n",
    "    - Status `0`: off\n",
    "    - Status `1`: on\n",
    "    - Status `2`: locked\n",
    "    - Status `3`: unlocked\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some factors may interfere with the correct detection of all screen events (e.g. when the phone's battery is depleated). Therefore, to correctly process screen data, we need to take into account other information like the battery status of the phone. This may complicate the preprocessing. To address this, `niimpy` includes a set of functions to clean, downsample, and extract features from screen data while taking into account factors like the battery level. The functions allow us to extract the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `screen_off`: reports when the screen has been turned off\n",
    "- `screen_count`: number of times the screen has turned on, off, or has been in use\n",
    "- `screen_duration`: duration in seconds of the screen on, off, and in use statuses\n",
    "- `screen_duration_min`: minimum duration in seconds of the screen on, off, and in use statuses\n",
    "- `screen_duration_max`: maximum duration in seconds of the screen on, off, and in use statuses\n",
    "- `screen_duration_median`: median duration in seconds of the screen on, off, and in use statuses\n",
    "- `screen_duration_mean`: mean duration in seconds of the screen on, off, and in use statuses\n",
    "- `screen_duration_std`: standard deviation of the duration in seconds of the screen on, off, and in use statuses\n",
    "- `screen_first_unlock`: reports the first time when the phone was unlocked every day\n",
    "- `extract_features_screen`: wrapper-like function to extract several features at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the screen module has three internal functions that help classify the events and calculate their status duration. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will analyze screen data provided by `niimpy` as an example to illustrate the use of screen data."

    "#### A few words on missing data\n",
    "Missing data for screen is difficult to detect. Firstly, this sensor is triggered by events and not sampled at a fixed frequency. Secondly, different phones, OS, and settings change how the screen is turned on/off; for example, one phone may go from OFF to ON to UNLOCKED, while another phone may go from OFF to UNLOCKED directly. Thirdly, events not related to the screen may affect its behavior, e.g. battery running out. Neverthless, there are some events transitions that are impossible to have, like a status to itself (e.g. two consecutive 0s). These *imposible* statuses helps us determine the missing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few words on the classification of the events\n",
    "We can know the status of the screen at a certain timepoint. However, we need a bit more to know the duration and the meaning of it. Consequently, we need to look at the numbers of two consecutive events and classify the transitions (going from one state to another consecutively) as:\n",
    "- from 3 to 0,1,2: the phone was in use \n",
    "- from 1 to 0,1,3: the phone was on\n",
    "- from 0 to 1,2,3: the phone was off\n",
    "\n",
    "Other transitions are irrelevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### A few words on the role of the battery\n",
    "As mentioned before, battery statuses can affect the screen behavior. In particular, when the battery is depleated and the phone is shut down automatically, the screen sensor does not cast any events, so even when the screen is technically OFF because the phone does not have any battery left, we will not see that 0 in the screen status column. Thus, it is important to take into account the battery information when analyzing screen data. `niimpy`'s screen module is adapted to take into account the battery data. \n",

    "#### 4.1.1 The argument dictionary for stand-alone functions (or how we specify the way a function works)\n",
    "We can input two types of arguments to customize the way a stand-alone function works:\n",
    "- the name of the columns to be preprocessed: Since the dataframe may have different columns, we need to specify which column has the data we would like to be preprocessed. To do so, we can simply pass the name of the column to the argument `screen_column_name`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- the way we resample: resampling options are specified in `niimpy` as a dictionary. `niimpy`'s resampling and aggregating relies on `pandas.DataFrame.resample`, so mastering the use of this pandas function will help us greatly in `niimpy`'s preprocessing. Please familiarize yourself with the pandas resample function before continuing. \n",
    "    Briefly, to use the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` function, we need a rule. This rule states the intervals we would like to use to resample our data (e.g., 15-seconds, 30-minutes, 1-hour). Neverthless, we can input more details into the function to specify the exact sampling we would like. For example, we could use the *close* argument if we would like to specify which side of the interval is closed, or we could use the *offset* argument if we would like to start our binning with an offset, etc. There are plenty of options to use this command, so we strongly recommend having `pandas.DataFrame.resample` documentation at hand. All features for the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` will be specified in a dictionary where keys are the arguments' names for the `pandas.DataFrame.resample`, and the dictionary's values are the values for each of these selected arguments. This dictionary will be passed as a value to the key `resample_args` in `niimpy`.\n",

For the feature screen_count, we will use the data stored in the column `one_name` and the data will be binned in one day periods with a 5-min offset.  For the feature screen_duration, we will use the data stored in the column `one_name` in our dataframe and the data will be binned using the default settings, i.e. 30-min bins. In addition, we will use data from the battery sensor, which will be passed in a column called \"some_column\". Finally, for the feature screen_duration_min, we will use the data stored in the column `another_name` in our dataframe and the data will be binned in 30-minute periods and the origin of the bins will be the ceiling midnight of the last day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Default values:** if no arguments are passed, `niimpy`'s default values are \"screen_status\" for the screen_column_name, and 30-min aggregation bins. Moreover, the wrapper will compute all the available functions in absence of the argument dictionary. \n",

    "#### 4.2.2 Using the wrapper\n",
    "Now that we understand how the wrapper is customized, it is time we compute our first communication feature using the wrapper. Suppose that we are interested in extracting the call total duration every 50 minutes. We will need `niimpy`'s `extract_features_comms` function, the data, and we will also need to create a dictionary to customize our function. Let's create the dictionary first"
