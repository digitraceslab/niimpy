    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio data - as recorded by smartphones or other portable devices - can carry important information about individuals' environments. This may give insights about the activity, sleep, and social interaction. However, using these data can be tricky due to privacy concerns, for example, conversations are highly identifiable. A possible solution is to compute more general characteristics (e.g. frequency) and use those instead to extract features. To address this last part, `niimpy` includes the function `extract_features_audio` to clean, downsample, and extract features from audio snippets that have been already anonymized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Audio dataframes should have the following columns (column names can be different, but in that case they must be provided as parameters):\n",
    "- `user`: Subject ID\n",
    "- `device`: Device ID\n",
    "- `is_silent`: Boolean value, indicates when audio is too quiet to record\n",
    "- `frequency`: Audio frequency in Hz\n",
    "- `decibels`: Audio volume in decibels\n",
    "\n",
    "Niimpy extracts the following audio features:\n",
    "- `audio_count_silent`: number of times when there has been some sound in the environment\n",
    "- `audio_count_speech`: number of times when there has been some sound in the environment that matches the range of human speech frequency (65 - 255Hz)\n",
    "- `audio_count_loud`: number of times when there has been some sound in the environment above 70dB\n",
    "- `audio_min_freq`: minimum frequency of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_max_freq`: maximum frequency of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_mean_freq`: mean frequency of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_median_freq`: median frequency of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_std_freq`: standard deviation of the frequency of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_min_db`: minimum decibels of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_max_db`: maximum decibels of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_mean_db`: mean decibels of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_median_db`: median decibels of the recorded audio snippets\n",
    "- `audio_std_db`: standard deviations of the recorded audio snippets decibels\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will analyze audio snippets provided by `niimpy` as an example to illustrate the use of niimpy's audio preprocessing functions."

    "## 4. Extracting features\n",
    "There are two ways to extract features. We could use each function separately or we could use `niimpy`'s ready-made wrapper. Both ways will require us to specify arguments to pass to the functions/wrapper in order to customize the way the functions work. These arguments are specified in dictionaries. Let's first understand how to extract features using stand-alone functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Extract features using stand-alone functions\n",
    "We can use `niimpy`'s functions to compute communication features. Each function will require two inputs:\n",
    "- (mandatory) dataframe that must comply with the minimum requirements (see '* TIP! Data requirements above)\n",
    "- (optional) arguments for stand-alone functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.1 The argument dictionary for stand-alone functions (or how we specify the way a function works)\n",
    "We can input two types of arguments to customize the way a stand-alone function works:\n",
    "- the name of the columns to be preprocessed: Since the dataframe may have different columns, we need to specify which column has the data we would like to be preprocessed. To do so, we can simply pass the name of the column to the argument `audio_column_name`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- the way we resample: resampling options are specified in `niimpy` as a dictionary. `niimpy`'s resampling and aggregating relies on `pandas.DataFrame.resample`, so mastering the use of this pandas function will help us greatly in `niimpy`'s preprocessing. Please familiarize yourself with the pandas resample function before continuing. \n",
    "    Briefly, to use the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` function, we need a rule. This rule states the intervals we would like to use to resample our data (e.g., 15-seconds, 30-minutes, 1-hour). Neverthless, we can input more details into the function to specify the exact sampling we would like. For example, we could use the *close* argument if we would like to specify which side of the interval is closed, or we could use the *offset* argument if we would like to start our binning with an offset, etc. There are plenty of options to use this command, so we strongly recommend having `pandas.DataFrame.resample` documentation at hand. All features for the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` will be specified in a dictionary where keys are the arguments' names for the `pandas.DataFrame.resample`, and the dictionary's values are the values for each of these selected arguments. This dictionary will be passed as a value to the key `resample_args` in `niimpy`.\n",
