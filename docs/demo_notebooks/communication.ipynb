    "\n",
    "In `niimpy`, communication data includes calls and SMS information. These data can reveal important information about people's circadian rhythm, social patterns, and activity, just to mention a few. Therefore, it is important to organize this information for further processing and analysis. To address this, `niimpy` includes a set of functions to clean, downsample, and extract features from communication data. The available features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `call_duration_total`: duration of incoming and outgoing calls\n",
    "- `call_duration_mean`: mean duration of incoming and outgoing calls\n",
    "- `call_duration_median`: median duration of incoming and outgoing calls\n",
    "- `call_duration_std`: standard deviation of incoming and outgoing calls\n",
    "- `call_count`: number of calls within a time window\n",
    "- `call_outgoing_incoming_ratio`: number of outgoing calls divided by the number of incoming calls\n",
    "- `sms_count`: count of incoming and outgoing text messages\n",
    "- `extract_features_comms`: wrapper to extract several features at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will analyze call logs provided by `niimpy` as an example to illustrate the use of niimpy's communication preprocessing functions."

    "There are two ways to extract features. We could use each function separately or we could use `niimpy`'s ready-made wrapper. Both ways will require us to specify arguments to pass to the functions/wrapper in order to customize the way the functions work. These arguments are specified in dictionaries. Let's first understand how to extract features using stand-alone functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Extract features using stand-alone functions\n",
    "We can use `niimpy`'s functions to compute communication features. Each function will require two inputs:\n",
    "- (mandatory) dataframe that must comply with the minimum requirements (see '* TIP! Data requirements above)\n",
    "- (optional) an argument dictionary for stand-alone functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.1 The argument dictionary for stand-alone functions (or how we specify the way a function works)\n",
    "In this dictionary, we can input two main features to customize the way a stand-alone function works:\n",
    "- the name of the columns to be preprocessed: Since the dataframe may have different columns, we need to specify which column has the data we would like to be preprocessed. To do so, we can simply pass the name of the column to the argument `communication_column_name`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- the way we resample: resampling options are specified in `niimpy` as a dictionary. `niimpy`'s resampling and aggregating relies on `pandas.DataFrame.resample`, so mastering the use of this pandas function will help us greatly in `niimpy`'s preprocessing. Please familiarize yourself with the pandas resample function before continuing. \n",
    "    Briefly, to use the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` function, we need a rule. This rule states the intervals we would like to use to resample our data (e.g., 15-seconds, 30-minutes, 1-hour). Neverthless, we can input more details into the function to specify the exact sampling we would like. For example, we could use the *close* argument if we would like to specify which side of the interval is closed, or we could use the *offset* argument if we would like to start our binning with an offset, etc. There are plenty of options to use this command, so we strongly recommend having `pandas.DataFrame.resample` documentation at hand. All features for the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` will be specified in a dictionary where keys are the arguments' names for the `pandas.DataFrame.resample`, and the dictionary's values are the values for each of these selected arguments. This dictionary will be passed as a value to the key `resample_args` in `niimpy`.\n",
