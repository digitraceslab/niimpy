    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Application data refers to the information about which apps are open at a certain time. These data can reveal important information about people's circadian rhythm, social patterns, and activity. Application data is an event data, this means that it cannot be sampled at a regular frequency, but we just have information about the events that occured. There are two main issues with application data (1) missing data detection, and (2) privacy concerns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding missing data detection, we may never know if all events were detected and reported. Unfortunately there is little we can do. Nevertheless, we can take into account some factors may interfere with the correct detection of all events (e.g. when the phone's battery is depleated). Therefore, to correctly process application data, we need to take into account other information like the battery status of the phone. \n",
    "Regarding the privacy concerns, application names can reveal too much about a subject, for example, for a uncommon app. Consequently, we need to try anonimizing the data by grouping the apps. `niimpy` provides a map with some of the common apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address both of these issues, `niimpy` includes the function `extract_features_app` to clean, downsample, and extract features from application data while taking into account factors like the battery level and naming groups. This function employs other functions to extract the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `app_count`: number of times an app group has been used \n",
    "- `app_duration`: how long an app group has been used\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the app module has one internal function that help classify the apps into groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will analyze screen data provided by `niimpy` as an example to illustrate the use of application data."

Secondly, different phones, OS, and settings change the ease to detect apps. Thirdly, events not related to the application sensor may affect its behavior, e.g. battery running out.
