    "* Please add unit tests which test each relevant feature (and each claimed method feature) with a minimal example.  Each function can have multiple tests.  For examples of unit tests, see below or ``niimpy/test_screen.py``.  You can create some sample data within each test module which can be used both during development and for tests."

    "  * Don't require `datetime` in your input\n",
    "  * Have any times returned in the index (unless each row needs multiple times, then do what you need)\n",
    "* Don't fail if there are extra columns passed (or missing some non-essential columns).  Look at what columns/data is passed and and use that, but don't do anything unexpected if someone makes a mistake with input data\n",
    "* Group by 'user' and 'device' columns if they are present in the input\n",
    "* Use `niimpy.util._read_sqlite_auto` function for getting data from input\n",
    "* Use `niimpy.filter.filter_dataframe` to do basic initial filterings based on standard arguments.\n",
    "* [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) is always good advice"
