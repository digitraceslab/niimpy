    "### Function inputs\n",
    "* Each function should accept two parameters: a dataframe and an optional dictionary containing other arguments.\n",
    "* Column names should be passed as optional arguments. They can have default values, but these should be adjustable.\n",
    "* Group by 'user' and 'device' columns if they are present in the input\n",
    "* You should always use the DataFrame index to retrieve data/time values, not the `datetime` column (which is a convenience thing but not guaranteed to be there).\n",
    "* Don't fail if there are extra columns passed (or missing some non-essential columns).  Look at what columns/data is passed and and use that, but don't do anything unexpected if someone makes a mistake with input data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function outputs\n",
    "* Have any times returned in the index (unless each row needs multiple times, then do what you need)\n",
    "* Resample by the time index, using given resample arguments (or a default value).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### other\n",
    "* Please add documentation to each new function using docstrings.  This should include enough description so that someone else can understand and reproduce all relevant features - enough to describe the method for a scientific article.\n",
    "* Please add unit tests which test each relevant feature (and each claimed method feature) with a minimal example.  Each function can have multiple tests.  For examples of unit tests, see below or ``niimpy/test_screen.py``.  You can create some sample data within each test module which can be used both during development and for tests.\n",
    "* [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) is always good advice"

    "- Improve the docstring of the function: we use the [numpydoc format](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)\n",
