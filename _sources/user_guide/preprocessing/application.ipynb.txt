    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Application data refers to the information about which apps are open at a certain time. These data can reveal important information about people's circadian rhythm, social patterns, and activity. Application data is an event data; this means it cannot be sampled at a regular frequency. Instead, we just have information about the events that occured. \n",
    "\n",
    "An application data dataframe contains a list of application events. Each row describes a single event and is indexed by a time stamp. The dataframe contains the following columns (column names can be different, but in that case they must be provided as parameters):\n",
    "- `user`: Subject ID.\n",
    "- `device`: Device ID.\n",
    "- `app_column`: Contains the name of an application used.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main issues with application data (1) missing data detection, and (2) privacy concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding missing data detection, we may never know if all events were detected and reported. Unfortunately there is little we can do. Nevertheless, we can take into account some factors that may interfere with the correct detection of all events (e.g. when the phone's battery is depleted). Therefore, to correctly process application data, we need to consider other information like the battery status of the phone. \n",
    "Regarding the privacy concerns, application names can reveal too much about a subject, for example, an uncommon app use may help identify a subject. Consequently, we try anonimizing the data by grouping the apps. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address both of these issues, `niimpy` includes the function `extract_features_app` to clean, downsample, and extract features from application data while taking into account factors like the battery level and naming groups. In addition, `niimpy` provides a map with some of the common apps for pseudo-anonymization. This function employs other functions to extract the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `app_count`: number of times an app group has been used \n",
    "- `app_duration`: how long an app group has been used\n",
    "\n",
    "The app module has one internal function that help classify the apps into groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will analyze screen data provided by `niimpy` as an example to illustrate the use of application data."

    "## 4. Extracting features\n",
    "There are two ways to extract features. We could use each function separately or we could use `niimpy`'s ready-made wrapper. Both ways will require us to specify arguments to pass to the functions/wrapper in order to customize the way the functions work. These arguments are specified in dictionaries. Let's first understand how to extract features using stand-alone functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Extract features using stand-alone functions\n",
    "We can use `niimpy`'s functions to compute communication features. Each function will require two inputs:\n",
    "- (mandatory) dataframe that must comply with the minimum requirements (see '* TIP! Data requirements above)\n",
    "- (optional) arguments for stand-alone functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1.1 The arguments for stand-alone functions (or how we specify the way a function works)\n",
    "We can input two types of arguments to customize the way a stand-alone function works:\n",
    "- the name of the columns to be preprocessed: Since the dataframe may have different columns, we need to specify which column has the data we would like to be preprocessed. To do so, we can simply pass the name of the column to the argument `app_column_name`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- the way we resample: resampling options are specified in `niimpy` as a dictionary. `niimpy`'s resampling and aggregating relies on `pandas.DataFrame.resample`, so mastering the use of this pandas function will help us greatly in `niimpy`'s preprocessing. Please familiarize yourself with the pandas resample function before continuing. \n",
    "    Briefly, to use the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` function, we need a rule. This rule states the intervals we would like to use to resample our data (e.g., 15-seconds, 30-minutes, 1-hour). Neverthless, we can input more details into the function to specify the exact sampling we would like. For example, we could use the *close* argument if we would like to specify which side of the interval is closed, or we could use the *offset* argument if we would like to start our binning with an offset, etc. There are plenty of options to use this command, so we strongly recommend having `pandas.DataFrame.resample` documentation at hand. All features for the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` will be specified in a dictionary where keys are the arguments' names for the `pandas.DataFrame.resample` function, and the dictionary's values are the values for each of these selected arguments. This dictionary will be passed as a value to the key `resample_args` in `niimpy`.\n",
